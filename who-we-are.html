            <p>
              The Coalition brings together organisations that recognise the need for more responsible ways of working with sand and silicates.
            </p>

            <p>
              We start from a simple assumption: meaningful and legitimate change is collective. No single actor can address the challenges or seize the opportunities alone. That assumption shapes how we convene, design projects and make decisions.
            </p>

            <p>Our strength lies in the mix of people and organisations involved, including:</p>

            <ul class="home-list">
              <li><strong>companies</strong> willing to move beyond narrow compliance and help shape future practice;</li>
              <li><strong>civil-society and research organisations</strong> bringing social, environmental and governance perspectives; and</li>
              <li><strong>public agencies and development partners</strong> connecting local practice with national and international policy.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Together, these perspectives help ensure that solutions are practical, credible and grounded in real-world conditions.
            </p>

            <h2>Where we are on the journey</h2>

            <p>
              The Coalition grew out of more than two years of global dialogue, experimentation and co-design. This included an OECD baseline study and an Interim Council convened by the Global Centre for Mineral Security at the Sustainable Minerals Institute, University of Queensland.
            </p>

            <p>Key moments include:</p>

            <ul class="home-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Asking the question</strong> — is it time to treat sand and silicates as part of responsible minerals supply? Research for the OECD confirmed that these materials belong on international agendas and exposed major gaps in existing standards and practice.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Co-designing what could be</strong> — a founder meeting in Barcelona in July 2025 shaped the Coalition’s purpose, scope and initial programme of work.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Formalising the transition</strong> — an Interim Council meeting in London in December 2025 endorsed the governance model, membership approach and identity, and supported the move to independence.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              We are now moving from project to organisation: from one-off studies to a standing platform designed to sustain collective action over time. We are preparing to open our doors to new members and host our public launch in mid-2026. This launch will be backed with our first wave of guidance and news on the rest of our projects for 2026–2028.

            <h2>Our governance</h2>

            <p>
              To work credibly, we need both independence and accountability. The Coalition is being established as a public company limited by guarantee in Australia with a not-for-profit and public-benefit purpose.
            </p>

            <p>Our governance includes:</p>

            <ul class="home-list">
              <li><strong>a Board of Directors</strong> with fiduciary responsibility;</li>
              <li><strong>a multi-stakeholder Advisory Council</strong> setting strategic direction and programme priorities; and</li>
              <li><strong>a light secretariat</strong> coordinating day-to-day work with members and partners.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              This structure keeps the Coalition mission-driven, transparent and open to diverse forms of participation.
            </p>

            <p>The secretariat keeps the core small, focused and nimble. Its role is to:</p>

            <ul class="home-list">
              <li>coordinate partnerships and hosting arrangements;</li>
              <li>lead outreach, fundraising, reporting and community coordination;</li>
              <li>develop the operational knowledge hub and technical resources;</li>
              <li>manage communications, brand and digital platforms; and</li>
              <li>ensure financial compliance and clear reporting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Meet the team</h3>

            <p>The Coalition is supported by a small core team working collaboratively and without hierarchy.</p>

            <ul class="home-list">
              <li><strong>Louise Gallagher, PhD</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Daniel Holm, PhD</strong></li>
              <li><strong>Elin Post</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              As a small team, we share responsibility across strategy, delivery and relationship-building. As the Coalition grows, this core team will be complemented by partners, secondees and member contributions.
            </p>

            <h3>Contacts</h3>

              <h2>Sand and silicates: why they matter</h2>

              <p class="lead">
                Sand and silicates are the most extracted solid materials on Earth. Each year, tens of billions of
                tonnes are used worldwide to build homes, infrastructure, electronics and energy systems. They have been
                part of human societies from the beginning. <strong>And they still underpin modern life.</strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                Aggregates, clays, industrial sands, natural stone and high-purity quartz are often treated as freely
                abundant and low risk. <strong>These assumptions no longer hold.</strong>
              </p>

              <ul class="home-list">
                <li><strong>Scale</strong> — demand is now large enough to shape ecosystems, landscapes and markets across the world.</li>
                <li><strong>Risk</strong> — environmental, social and human-rights concerns are observed for some extraction and use practices in many different contexts.</li>
                <li><strong>Governance gaps</strong> — responsibility frameworks have not kept pace with reality. Sand and silicates still sit largely outside our practices for responsible minerals sourcing and use. Public governance is often fragmented.</li>
                <li><strong>Supply pressure</strong> — in some markets, access already affects cost, timing and project viability.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                When materials are taken for granted, questions of origin, management and accountability fade. The
                consequences of this invisibility are now clear. Sand and silicate supply chains are linked to
                human-rights, environmental and systemic risks, including growing pressure on secure supply.
              </p>

              <p>
                Responsible public governance and business conduct are no longer optional. Yet responsibility for sand
                and silicates remains weakly defined. <strong>This creates a rare opening.</strong> There is room to lead —
                to innovate, set credible benchmarks, and open new pathways for value creation and resilience.

              <h2>Why a Coalition for Responsible Sand and Silicates</h2>

              <p class="lead">
                We exist to ensure that sand and silicate resources are sourced, used and managed in ways that create
                value for people and the planet.
              </p>

              <p>
                Attention to sand and silicates is increasing — driven by minerals policy, construction decarbonisation
                and supply-security debates. Expectations are changing. But standards, knowledge, business tools and
                innovation have not yet caught up with these shifts.
              </p>

              <p><strong>The Coalition is founded on two simple premises.</strong></p>

              <p>
                First, no single actor can address these challenges alone. Responsibility for sand and silicates spans
                extractive activities, processing, manufacturing, use and reuse — across sectors and jurisdictions.
              </p>

              <p>
                Second, those who want to act early to help shape what responsibility looks like in practice need a
                place to do so — with shared evidence, practical support and the conditions to move faster together than
                they could alone.
              </p>

              <p>
                At its core, our work is about restoring regard for these materials — reconnecting how they are sourced
                and managed with the systems, places and people they affect. <strong>We see this as an opportunity to build
                shared understanding, credible guidance and coordinated action on a complex issue.</strong>
              </p>

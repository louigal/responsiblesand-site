            <h2>Sand and silicates: why they matter</h2>

            <p>
              Sand and silicates are the most extracted solid materials on Earth; and they are essential to housing,
              infrastructure, electronics and energy systems.
            </p>

            <p>
              Aggregates, clays, industrial sands, natural stone and high-purity quartz underpin modern life. Yet are widely
              treated as abundant and low risk. Because of this, they sit largely outside the frameworks used to define
              responsible sourcing and use. When materials are taken for granted, questions of origin, impact and
              accountability fade.
            </p>

            <p>
              The consequences are now clear. Sand and silicate supply chains are linked to human rights, environmental and
              systemic risks, including growing pressure on secure supply. So, responsible business conduct and public
              governance are no longer optional for these materials.
            </p>

            <p>
              Gaps in expectations and practices for responsible supply chains can create rare openings. Yes, responsibility
              for sand and silicates is weakly defined. That leaves room to lead. To innovate. To set credible benchmarks and
              open new pathways for value creation and resilience.

            <h2>Why a Coalition for Responsible Sand and Silicates</h2>

            <p>
              We exist to ensure that sand and silicate resources are sourced, used and managed in ways that create value
              for people and the planet.
            </p>

            <p>
              Attention to sand and silicates is increasing because of minerals policy, construction decarbonisation and
              supply-security debates. Standards, knowledge availability, business management tools and innovation must keep
              pace with this change.
            </p>

            <p>No single actor can address this shift alone.</p>

            <p>
              The Coalition brings together companies, public-good actors and standard-setters to build shared understanding,
              develop practical guidance and coordinate action.
            </p>

            <p>
              At its core, our work is about restoring our regard for these materials. Reconnecting their management with
              the systems, places and people they affect.

            <p>The Coalition is a cross-sector platform focused on five actions:</p>

            <ul class="home-list">
              <li><strong>Defining responsibility</strong> — shaping clear norms and guidance, practical tools and shared red lines and green flags.</li>
              <li><strong>Demonstrating solutions</strong> — testing due diligence approaches and innovation practices in real projects and supply chains under real world conditions.</li>
              <li><strong>Building shared intelligence</strong> — providing a knowledge hub and making data and insights actionable.</li>
              <li><strong>Aligning existing efforts</strong> — working with civil society, industries, standards bodies and policy processes to identify and filling gaps for these materials.</li>
              <li><strong>Connecting people</strong> — bringing different groups together in dialogue and sense-making to achieve lasting change through joint problem-solving and coordinated action.</li>

                expectations, particularly in construction, glass, infrastructure, technology and manufacturing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Civil-society and research organisations</strong> contributing expertise on resource governance,

            <h2>Sand and silicates: why they matter</h2>

            <p>
Sand and silicates are the most extracted solid materials on Earth. Each year, tens of billions of tonnes are used worldwide to build homes, 
              infrastructure, electronics and energy systems. They have been part of human societies from the beginning, and they still underpin modern life.
            </p>

            <p>
Yet aggregates, clays, industrial sands, natural stone and high-purity quartz are often treated as freely abundant and low risk. 
              This is not the case. The scale of consumption, the roles these materials play in ecosystems, and the impacts 
              of some extraction practices make that clear. Even so, sand and silicates sit largely outside 
              the frameworks used to define responsible sourcing and use.
            </p>

            <p>
When materials are taken for granted, questions of origin, management and accountability fade. The consequences of this invisibility are now clear. 
              Sand and silicate supply chains are linked to human rights, environmental and systemic risks, including growing pressure on secure supply. 
              In some markets, access to suitable materials is already shaping project viability, cost and timing.
            </p>

            <p>
Responsible public governance and business conduct are no longer optional. Yet responsibility for sand and silicates remains weakly defined. This creates a rare opening. 
              There is room to lead — to innovate, set credible benchmarks, and open new pathways for value creation and resilience.

            <h2>Why a Coalition for Responsible Sand and Silicates</h2>

            <p>
              We exist to ensure that sand and silicate resources are sourced, used and managed in ways that create
              value for people and the planet.
            </p>

            <p>
              Attention to sand and silicates is increasing because of minerals policy, construction decarbonisation and
              supply-security debates. Standards, knowledge availability, business management tools and innovation must
              keep pace with this change.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Coalition is founded on two premises. No single actor can address this shift alone. And those who act
              early can help shape the path others will follow. It brings together companies, public-good actors and
              standard-setters to build shared understanding, develop practical guidance and coordinate action.
            </p>

            <p>
              At its core, our work is about restoring our regard for these materials. Reconnecting their management
              with the systems, places and people they affect.
            </p>

            <p>The Coalition is a cross-sector platform focused on five actions:</p>

            <ul class="home-list">
              <li><strong>Defining responsibility</strong> — shaping clear norms and guidance, practical tools and shared red lines and green flags.</li>
              <li><strong>Demonstrating solutions</strong> — testing due diligence approaches and innovation practices in real projects and supply chains under real world conditions.</li>
              <li><strong>Building shared intelligence</strong> — providing a knowledge hub and making data and insights actionable.</li>
              <li><strong>Aligning existing efforts</strong> — working with civil society, industries, standards bodies and policy processes to identify and filling gaps for these materials.</li>
              <li><strong>Connecting people</strong> — bringing different groups together in dialogue and sense-making to achieve lasting change through joint problem-solving and coordinated action.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The Coalition is for organisations that rely on sand and silicates and recognise the need for more
              responsible ways of working with them.
            </p>

            <p>We work with:</p>

            <ul class="home-list">
              <li>
                <strong>Industry leaders and innovators</strong> seeking to improve sourcing, manage risk and shape
                future expectations, particularly in construction, glass, infrastructure, technology and manufacturing.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Civil-society and research organisations</strong> contributing expertise on resource governance,

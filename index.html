            <h2>Why do sand and silicates matter?</h2>

            <p>
              Sand and silicates are the foundation of modern life and the most extracted solid materials on Earth.
              Each year, tens of billions of tonnes are used worldwide to build homes, infrastructure, electronics and energy systems.
              They have been part of human societies from the beginning, and they will remain so.
            </p>

            <p>
              Aggregates, clays, industrial sands, natural stone and high-purity quartz are often treated as freely abundant and low risk.
              These assumptions no longer hold.
            </p>

            <ul class="key-points" aria-label="Why assumptions no longer hold">
              <li><strong>Scale</strong> — demand is now large enough to shape ecosystems, landscapes and markets across the world.</li>
              <li><strong>Risk</strong> — environmental, social and human-rights risks and impacts are observed in extraction and use in many different contexts.</li>
              <li><strong>Governance gaps</strong> — responsibility frameworks have failed to keep pace with reality. Sand and silicates still sit largely outside established practices for responsible minerals sourcing and use. Public governance is often fragmented.</li>
              <li><strong>Supply pressure</strong> — in some markets, access already affects cost, timing and project viability.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
When materials are taken for granted, questions of origin, management and accountability fade. The consequences of this invisibility are all linked to human rights, environmental and systemic risks, including growing pressure on secure supply. 
            </p>

            <p>
              Responsible public governance and business conduct are no longer optional. Yet responsibility for sand and silicates remains weakly defined.
              This creates a rare opening. There is room to lead — to innovate, set legitimate benchmarks and open new pathways for value creation and resilience.

              Attention to sand and silicates is increasing — driven by minerals policy, construction decarbonisation and supply-security debates. Expectations are changing. But standards, knowledge, business tools and innovation have yet to catch up.
            </p>

            <p>
              No single actor can address these challenges alone. And those who want to act early to shape what responsibility looks like in practice need a shared place to do so — one that lets them move faster together.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Coalition meets these needs, generating new practices, guidance and knowledge that ensures sand and silicates resources are sourced and managed in ways that create value for people and the planet.

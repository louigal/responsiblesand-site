          Building a future where sand and silicates are sourced, used and managed responsibly

    <section class="home-section" id="why-they-matter">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Sand and silicates: why they matter</h2>

        <p>
          Sand and silicates are the most extracted solid materials on Earth. They are essential to housing,
          infrastructure, electronics and energy systems.
        </p>

        <figure class="home-figure">
          <img
            src="assets/home/products-montage.jpg"
            alt="Sketch montage showing a range of product and sector uses connected to sand and silicates.">
        </figure>

        <p>
          These materials — aggregates, clays, industrial sands, natural stone and high-purity quartz — underpin modern
          life, yet are still widely treated as abundant and low risk.
        </p>

        <p>
          Because of this, they sit largely outside the frameworks used to define responsible sourcing and use. When
          materials are taken for granted, questions of origin, impact and accountability fade.
        </p>

        <p>
          The consequences are now clear. Sand and silicate supply chains are linked to human rights, environmental and
          systemic risks, including growing pressure on secure supply.
        </p>

        <p>
          Responsible public governance and business conduct are no longer optional. At the same time, gaps in
          expectations and practice create a rare opening. Responsibility for sand and silicates is still weakly
          defined, leaving room to lead — to innovate, set credible benchmarks and open new pathways for value creation
          and resilience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Those who move early can help shape the rules others will later follow.

    <section class="home-section" id="why-a-coalition">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Why a Coalition for Responsible Sand and Silicates</h2>

        <p>
          We exist to ensure that sand and silicate resources are sourced, used and managed in ways that create value
          for people, companies and the planet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Attention to sand and silicates is increasing across construction decarbonisation, minerals policy and
          supply-security debates. But expectations, tools and incentives are not keeping pace.
        </p>

        <p>
          No single actor can address this alone. The Coalition brings together companies, public-good actors and
          standard-setters to build shared understanding, develop practical guidance and coordinate action.
        </p>

        <p>
          At its core, our work is about restoring regard — reconnecting materials with the systems, places and people
          they affect.

        <h2>What we do</h2>

        <p>The Coalition is a cross-sector platform focused on four areas:</p>

        <ul class="home-list">
          <li><strong>Define responsibility</strong> — set clear guidance, practical tools and shared red lines.</li>
          <li><strong>Demonstrate solutions</strong> — test approaches in real projects and supply chains.</li>
          <li><strong>Build shared intelligence</strong> — make data and insight usable.</li>
          <li><strong>Align existing efforts</strong> — work with standards and policy processes to fill gaps.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </section>

    <!-- SECTION 4 -->
    <section class="home-section" id="who-we-stand-for">
      <div class="container">
        <h2>Who we stand for</h2>

        <p>
          The Coalition is for organisations that rely on sand and silicates and recognise the need for more
          responsible ways of working with them.
        </p>

        <p>We work with:</p>

        <ul class="home-list">
          <li>
            <strong>Industry leaders and innovators</strong> seeking to improve sourcing, manage risk and shape future
            expectations, particularly in construction, glass, infrastructure, technology and manufacturing.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Civil-society and research organisations</strong> contributing expertise on resource governance,
            biodiversity, social performance, circular economy and community development.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Policymakers and regulators</strong> developing frameworks for sustainable sourcing and use of
            mineral-based materials.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We bring these groups together because lasting change depends on shared problem-solving and coordinated
          action.
        </p>

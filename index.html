            <h2>Sand and silicates: why they matter</h2>

            <p class="lead">
              Sand and silicates are the most extracted solid materials on Earth. Each year, tens of billions of tonnes
              are used worldwide to build homes, infrastructure, electronics and energy systems. They have been part of
              human societies from the beginning — and they still underpin modern life.
            </p>

            <p>
              Yet aggregates, clays, industrial sands, natural stone and high-purity quartz are often treated as freely
              abundant and low risk. This is not the case. The scale of consumption, the roles these materials play in
              ecosystems, and the impacts of some extraction practices make that clear. Even so, sand and silicates sit
              largely outside the frameworks used to define responsible sourcing and use.
            </p>

            <ul class="home-list">
              <li><strong>Scale</strong> — demand is now large enough to shape ecosystems, landscapes and markets.</li>
              <li><strong>Risk</strong> — impacts and rights concerns concentrate in particular contexts and practices.</li>
              <li><strong>Governance gap</strong> — responsibility frameworks have not kept pace with reality.</li>
              <li><strong>Supply pressure</strong> — in some markets, access already affects cost, timing and viability.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              When materials are taken for granted, questions of origin, management and accountability fade. The
              consequences of this invisibility are now clear. Sand and silicate supply chains are linked to human
              rights, environmental and systemic risks, including growing pressure on secure supply.
            </p>

            <p>
              Responsible public governance and business conduct are no longer optional. Yet responsibility for sand and
              silicates remains weakly defined. This creates a rare opening. There is room to lead — to innovate, set
              credible benchmarks, and open new pathways for value creation and resilience.

            <h2>Why a Coalition for Responsible Sand and Silicates</h2>

            <p class="lead">
              We exist to ensure that sand and silicate resources are sourced, used and managed in ways that create
              value for people and the planet.
            </p>

            <p>
              Attention to sand and silicates is increasing because of minerals policy, construction decarbonisation and
              supply-security debates. Standards, knowledge availability, business management tools and innovation must
              keep pace with this change.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Coalition is founded on two premises. No single actor can address this shift alone. And those who act
              early can help shape the path others will follow. We bring together companies, public-good actors and
              standard-setters to build shared understanding, develop practical guidance and coordinate action.
            </p>

            <p>
              At its core, our work is about restoring our regard for these materials — reconnecting their management
              with the systems, places and people they affect.

              The Coalition is for organisations that rely on sand and silicates — and recognise the need for more

              If you are navigating sourcing risk, due diligence expectations, decarbonisation pressures, biodiversity

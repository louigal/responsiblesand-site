            <h2>What membership involves</h2>
            <p>
              Membership is open to organisations that have a clear stake in how sand and silicates are sourced, used or governed; that support the Coalition's purpose; and that are willing to contribute constructively to shared work.
            </p>
            <p>
              In practice, that means shared commitments to engagement, good practice and collective problem-solving. The details are set out in the membership agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fees are tiered by actor type and organisational size. We're co-designing the fee structure with our Founder members, and details will be shared as they're finalised.

        Aligned with our ways of working, we're co-designing the fee structure with our Founder members.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Fees will be structured around the size and nature of the organisation, and aligned with the level of claim that comes with being a member of the Coalition. We're working to ensure the approach is fair, transparent and supports the Coalition's long-term sustainability.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The fee schedule will be shared once it's been finalised. If you have questions in the meantime, or want to talk through what membership might look like for your organisation, we're happy to have that conversation.

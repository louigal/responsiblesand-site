            Sand and silicates are in almost everything we build, make and use. Almost no one is working on how to source them responsibly. Not yet.

        <h2>This is early. That's the point.</h2>
        <p>
          The data on sand and silicates is thin. The standards don't cover them yet. The risks are real — but so are the opportunities, for the companies, researchers and policymakers who move now.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Coalition exists to do this work together, before the field hardens around assumptions rather than evidence.

          <h3>A head start on the evidence</h3>
          <p>The Coalition's work builds on two foundational studies — one for the OECD, one for GIZ — and members get access to the findings, the analysis and the conversations around them as they develop. In a topic where good data is scarce, that's a real advantage.</p>

          <h3>A seat at the table while norms are forming</h3>
          <p>Sand and silicates will come onto responsible-minerals agendas. The question is whether the standards and expectations that emerge reflect how things actually work, or whether they're written by people who don't know. Members help make sure it's the former.</p>

          <p>This isn't a talking group. Members contribute experience, test ideas in real supply chains, and help turn learning into guidance that others can use. The emphasis is on shared problem-solving, not positioning.</p>

            <p>
              The Coalition's initial work builds on two foundational studies led by the University of Queensland, 2024–2026:
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>A study for the OECD</strong> on due diligence for sand and silicates supply chains, publishing in early 2026. It confirms these materials belong on international responsible-minerals agendas and documents major gaps in existing standards, tools and practice.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>A study for GIZ</strong> on raw materials in semiconductor supply chains, currently underway. It situates sand and silicates within wider debates on supply security, due diligence and industrial policy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Together, these form a shared analytical baseline — the starting point for the guidance, tools and demonstrations developed with members. This work also builds on earlier research the UQ team undertook with the United Nations Environment Programme.

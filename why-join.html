            <h2>What the Coalition offers</h2>

            <p>
              The Coalition offers a trusted place to work on responsible sand and silicates in a structured, evidence-led way.
            </p>

            <h3>An active community already working it out</h3>
            <p>
              Members work alongside peers, researchers and public institutions to shape evolving practice, test approaches in real supply chains, and learn together. The emphasis is on shared problem-solving, not positioning.
            </p>
            <p>
              Participation is hands-on. Members contribute experience, test ideas, and help translate learning into guidance that others can use.

            <h2>Access to an emerging evidence base</h2>

            <p>
              The Coalition is grounded in applied research and field-based analysis.
            </p>

            <p>
              Our initial work builds on two foundational studies led by the University of Queensland team 2024 - 2026:
            </p>

            <ul class="home-list">
              <li>
                A study for the OECD on supply chain due diligence for sand and silicates supply chains, publishing in early 2026. This work confirms that sand and silicates belong on international responsible minerals agendas and documents major gaps in existing standards, tools and practice. It provides a practical starting point for organisations assessing relevance, risk and opportunity.
              </li>
              <li>
                A study for GIZ on raw materials in semiconductor supply chains, currently underway. This work situates sand and silicates within wider debates on supply security, due diligence and industrial policy, and informs early dialogue with industry and governments.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Together, these studies form a shared analytical baseline. They are the starting point for the guidance, tools, demonstrations and learning developed with members. This initial work complements earlier work the UQ team undertook with the United Nations Environment Programme.

            <p>
              The Coalition provides a structured way to work on sand and silicates across value chains and public-interest domains.
            </p>

            <p>
              Membership signals a commitment to engage seriously with a new and complex issue that spans business performance, sustainability and public policy. The fact that this work is done collectively — across companies, civil society and public actors — is itself a signal: that expectations are shifting, and that practical pathways for change are being built.

              <li>publish an initial framing of responsible sand and silicates, and translate it into usable guidance;</li>
              <li>test due-diligence and risk tools in selected supply chains;</li>
              <li>deliver one or more flagship demonstration projects in live settings;</li>
              <li>produce accessible guidance, case material and communications; and</li>
              <li>continue structured dialogue and sense-making to sharpen results and identify new opportunities.</li>

        <h2>Intended gains</h2>

        <h3>For downstream members</h3>
        <p>
          Downstream members gain the opportunity to influence new norms, buyer expectations and due-diligence tools while they are still forming. By contributing practical know-how, members help ensure that future expectations reflect operational realities. In return, they gain earlier visibility of risks and requirements, and a lower-risk way to prepare for change.
        </p>

        <h3>For upstream producers</h3>
        <p>
          Upstream producers gain a direct role in shaping how responsibility for sand and silicates is defined by downstream actors. Through constructive engagement with companies, policymakers and civil-society organisations, members can build credibility, trust and shared understanding — and explore new narratives and business practices linked to sustainability, resilience and long-term value.
        </p>

        <h3>For public-good actors</h3>
        <p>
          For policymakers, researchers, civil-society organisations and foundations, the Coalition offers a way to co-design research and action agendas with impact built in. Members can test ideas in real supply chains, connect policy and practice, and help translate foresight into workable approaches for materials governance and innovation.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Across the Coalition, we aim to support:</strong></p>
        <ul class="home-list">
          <li>pre-competitive public–private–civic partnerships that can scale beyond individual pilots or places;</li>
          <li>faster internal learning and alignment, reducing duplication and uncertainty; and</li>
          <li>shared intelligence to support risk foresight, supply-chain due diligence and strategic decision-making.</li>
        </ul>

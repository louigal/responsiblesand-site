            <h2>Why it matters</h2>
 
            <p>
              Sand and silicates are the foundation of modern life and the most extracted solid materials on Earth.
              Each year, tens of billions of tonnes are used worldwide to build homes, infrastructure, electronics and energy systems.
              They have been part of human societies from the beginning, and they will remain so.
            </p>
 
            <p>
              Aggregates, clays, industrial sands, natural stone and high-purity quartz are often treated as freely abundant and low risk.
              These assumptions no longer hold.
            </p>
 
            <ul class="key-points" aria-label="Why assumptions no longer hold">
              <li><strong>Scale</strong> — demand is now large enough to shape ecosystems, landscapes and markets across the world.</li>
              <li><strong>Risk</strong> — environmental, social and human-rights risks and impacts are observed in extraction and use in many different contexts.</li>
              <li><strong>Governance gaps</strong> — responsibility frameworks have failed to keep pace with reality. Sand and silicates still sit largely outside established practices for responsible minerals sourcing and use. Public governance is often fragmented.</li>
              <li><strong>Supply pressure</strong> — in some markets, access already affects cost, timing and project viability.</li>
            </ul>
 
            <p>
              When materials are taken for granted, questions of origin, management and accountability fade. The consequences of this invisibility are linked to human-rights, environmental and systemic risks, including growing pressure on secure supply.
            </p>
 
            <p>
              Responsible public governance and business conduct are no longer optional. Yet responsibility for sand and silicates remains weakly defined.
              This creates a rare opening. There is room to lead — to innovate, set legitimate benchmarks and open new pathways for value creation and resilience.

          <h2>Where we are on the journey</h2>
          
          <p>
            This Coalition exists because of the vision and generosity of the <a href="https://smi.uq.edu.au/gcms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Centre for Mineral Security</a> and the leadership of Professor Daniel Franks at The University of Queensland's Sustainable Minerals Institute. The Centre provided our intellectual home, supported the research that made this work credible, and created the conditions for collaboration across industry, civil society and research.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The Centre's work was supported by funding from The University of Queensland through its Resourcing Decarbonisation and Trailblazer initiatives, IKEA, Roca Group and MCS Group. We're grateful for their partnership and excited to see where this collaborative journey leads next.
          </p>

          </p>
          
          <p><strong>Key moments</strong></p>
          
          <ul class="timeline">
            <li>
              <strong>Asking the question</strong> — is it time to treat sand and silicates as part of responsible minerals supply? Research conducted at the Global Centre for Mineral Security for IKEA and the OECD, between 2022 and 2024, confirmed these materials belong on international agendas and exposed major gaps in existing standards.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Co-designing what could be</strong> — a founder meeting in Barcelona in July 2025 shaped the Coalition's purpose, scope and initial programme of work. We're grateful to Roca Group for generously hosting us.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Formalising the transition</strong> — an Interim Council meeting in London in December 2025 endorsed the governance model, membership approach and identity, and supported the move to independence. We're grateful to Roca Group for generously hosting us. We're opening membership and launching publicly in mid-2026, backed by our first wave of guidance and projects for 2026–2028.
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            Many people and organisations have helped us on our way, and we're grateful for their support.
